Mediaserver
=============

#### Introduction
A mediaserver with a Node.js + MongoDB backend and a HTML + JavaScript frontend.

Note:
The frontend might render correctly in every browser, due to use of HTML5 tags
which aren't available in every browser. Tested with Chrome on Ubuntu 14.04 (x64)

#### Dependencies
The mediaserver relies on the following thirdparty packages

* mongodb
* musicmetadata
